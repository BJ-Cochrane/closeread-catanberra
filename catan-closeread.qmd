I find it difficult to apply myself if the goal is not something that does not have a ridiculous end point.

What started as a foire into learning GIS, turned into a full-blown mission, blood sweat and tears.

This is the journey of creating CATANberra, a geographically accurate version of Australia as a Catan board.



## The geographic grounding

The Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry (ABARES) very politely publishes land use data mapped at a national scale.[^1] [@cr-map]

It is a very colourful representation of what land is used for what purpose in Australia, all based on ️satellite images

You can see a large chunk of Australia is either <span style='color:#c9c9b5;'>**Grazing native vegetation**</span>, <span style='color:#9666CC;'>**Nature conservations**</span>,<span style='color:#C9BEFF;'>**Other minimal use**</span> [@cr-map]{scale-by="2"}

The 18-class classification processes assigns land to one of **18 unique land uses.** [@cr-map]{pan-to="50%,-30%" scale-by="1.75"}

These land uses must be sorted into the relevant Catan tiles, namely:
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style='font-size:40pt'>
🐑 Wool  
🌾 Grain  
🌲 Lumber  
⛰️ Ore   
🧱 Brick  
🌵️ Desert
</span>
</div>

[@cr-map]{pan-to="50%,-30%" scale-by="1.75"}

<span style='font-size:25pt'>Some of these categories line up nicely, </span>

<span style='font-size:25pt'><span style='color:#FFFFE5;'>Grazing native vegetation</span> is great for 🐑</span>

<span style='font-size:25pt'><span style='color:#C9B854;'>Irrigated cropping</span>, and <span style='color:#FFFF00;'>dryland cropping</span> is great for 🌾</span>

<span style='font-size:25pt'><span style='color:#298944;'>Production native forests</span>, <span style='color:#ADFFB5;'>plantation forests</span> and <span style='color:#9666CC;'>Nature conservations</span> can be 🌲</span>

<span style='font-size:25pt'><span style='color:#47828F;'>Mining and waste</span> are quite clearly ⛰️</span>

<span style='font-size:25pt'><span style='color:#0000FF;'>Water</span> is probably the most likely place to get mud to make some 🧱</span>

<span style='font-size:25pt'>And anything that is <span style='color:#C9BEFF;'>Other minimal use</span>(aka nothing) <span style='color:#0000FF;'>Water</span> can be considered our 🌵</span>

You can see the final categorisations I decided on here. [@cr-landuse]

Importantly, I decided that <span style='color:#DE87DD;'>**Managed resource protection**</span> could mean a lot of things. [@cr-landuse]{scale-by='2.5'}

So I decided to assign it at random.

Here is the code [@cr-code]

And because our resource allocations are a little varying, I decided this 'randomness' should favour more scarce resources [@cr-code]{highlight="3,7"}

:::{#cr-code .scale-to-fill}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| output: false

randomise_land_use <- function(df) {
  # Set weights and land use types
  land_use_weights <- c(Desert = 0.2, Brick = 0.35, Lumber = 0.1, Ore = 0.35)
  
  # Randomize land use for rows where land_use_descrip is "Managed resource protection"
  df$catan_use <- ifelse(
    df$land_use_descrip == "Managed resource protection",
    sample(
      names(land_use_weights), 
      sum(df$land_use_descrip == "Managed resource protection"), 
      prob = land_use_weights
    ),
    df$catan_use
  )
  
  return(df)
}
```

Now, it's not a perfect fit.

In September, the army reached Moscow, which was by then sacked and deserted, with 100,000 men. @cr-map

The path of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow is depicted by the darker, lower band, which is linked to a temperature scale and dates at the bottom of the chart. It was a bitterly cold winter, and many froze on the march out of Russia. @cr-map

As the graphic shows, the crossing of the Berezina River was a disaster, and the army finally struggled back into Poland with only 10,000 men remaining. @cr-map

Also shown are the movements of auxiliary troops, as they sought to protect the rear and the flank of the advancing army.

Minard's graphic tells a rich, coherent story with its multivariate data, far more enlightening than just a single number bouncing along over time. Six variables are plotted: @cr-map

It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn.
